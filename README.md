# CryptoClustering

In Module 19, I preprocessed the data using StandardScaler, found the optimal 'k' value using the original scaled data, and performed cryptocurrency clustering with K-means. I then improved the clusters using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), determined the best 'k' value for PCA data, and conducted cryptocurrency clustering with K-means using the PCA data. I also provided responses to specific questions along the way.
